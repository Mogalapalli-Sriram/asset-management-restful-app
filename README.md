# RESTful API's 


## About Code
The code is about using RESTful API's from scratch by which we can render the data from the server and add the data into the server by using the HTTP request verbs.



## Tehcnologies used to run the code

* code text editors (Atom or visual studio code)
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Hyper Terminal
* API clients(postman or insomnia)



## How to run the app

1. Firstly we need to initialise the node package manager in hyper terminal,so that a package.json file gets created.

2. Then we need to install the express npm which gets saved as dependency in the package.json file.

3. After that we need to require express npm in app.js. Then create express application. Then using express.js and node.js we need to create the server locally on our computer and host(tune) it on the port number 3000. Then using hyper terminal we need to start the server by using the command given below

4. I have made use of one of the API client [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) API client to generate the HTTP request verbs.



## API'S I have used in my App?

I have made use of the Post and Get request verbs of HTTP. Used Post to write(insert) the data to the server where the data can be reused in the server.



## Accessing the API's

I have accessed the API's such as Get and Post by using the express application and used route and callback function in Get and Post function call.



## Inspiration

I got inspired to  create this application after having an access to one of the useful resource on the [youtube](https://youtu.be/-MTSQjw5DrM). 



## API's and RESTful API's

API's are abbreviated as Application Programmable Interfaces. The are considered as menu of commands,functions,protocols related to server that are exposed to the client or user such that the user can have an access to it and get interacted with the server. They are mediators between the external server and user system( user server).


RESTful API's are the architectural styles used to create our own API's. But the important thing is we need to follow the set of rules while using RESTful API's.

 The set of rules are :-
 1. Use HTTP request verbs.
 2. Use specific pattern for routes or URL's.



 ## API clients

 API clients are the one by which we can generate the various HTTP request verbs such as GET,POST,PATCH,PULL,DELETE.
 
 The other benefit is that they reduce the length of the code.So there is no need to create a seperate html file to add form elements in order to post the form data to the server.
   
The most popular API clients among other API clients  are:-
1. [postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/)
2. [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
